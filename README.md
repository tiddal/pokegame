## 📃 About

This project is part of a series of projects developed in Colt Steele's course - The Modern React Bootcamp. This is my iteration and it differs in the technologies I used and the styles I made.

In this game, two hands of "Pokecards" are drafted from a fake database with 8 pokemons. The hand with the highest total experience wins the round.
